Assigned Tasks

Client Side
Completion Date: in progress
[12/03/2021]: Created the react app.  Created all the component files inside of the application.
              Was able to get all the fetches, props, and state setup.  
              
[12/04/2021]: Did styling to the Signup, Login, Auth, and the Chore page.

[12/05/2021]: Added more content to the Signup, Login component's styling.

[12/07/2021]: Worked exclusively on the ChoreCreate component. Have a create chore table, with results that render in to cards.

[12/09/2021]:  Made the created chore cards break a new line when you have more than 3. Did some setup of the styling of the cards.

[12/10/2021]:  Began doing the routing, Added the logic to the App.js file. Created a Showcase.js for our landing page.  Links between Login 
and Signup are working.  On signup, made it check for a token to see the choreIndex.  Working on Signup status still.

[12/11/2021]: Fixed Navbar buttons to display the proper link depending on logged in status. Got the routing setup in App.js and passed props around.
Also fixed a couple bugs in the fetches. Linked the Signup and Login pages. Also got them to redirect to Chore table when successfull.

Added a search by name input on the choretable. -- This to try to complete the MVP requirement of being able to sort peoples chores.

Started working on the keep running Amount total MVP requirement.

[12/12/2021]:  Signup.js, Login.js - Inputs are now all required, changed username to Email. Email input requires email. Password inputs are hidden.  Added conditionals to check for status, and display errorMessage if login or signup is unsuccessful.

ChoreTable.js - Added a new fetch to get all the user's chores. Created the button, and styled it into the page. I also re did the Create chore box, and changed all the inputs around. Date input takes in a date from a drop down calendar, Amount input only allows numbers. And all are required.

Added the placeholder text for final challenge for MVP (running total of amounts paid.)

ChoreEdit.js - Got the general styling, and placement laid out. Changed all the inputs to match the CreateChore inputs. 

[12/14/2021]: Having issues witht he fetchChores function.  Wrote some conditionals in ChoreTable.js to show correct components before and after search. 

[12/15/2021]: Resolved issue with the fetchChores.  Chore table is displaying properly now.  All fetchs working.  Created PayButton.js to attempt to complete the MVP with the running total amounts paid. 

[12/17/2021] : Worked on the footer, and provided contact.  Made ChoreTable show no chore history if no chores have been created by the user.

Modified the date input, to show name of month followed by day, and year.

Worked on the Total amount paid feature. Was able to get it partially working.

Edited Signup.js and Login.js to improve contrast.
